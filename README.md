# knowledge-aquisition
A place to put projects and snippets of things that I am learning and/or what to share for others that are learning.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

I want to create a place where I can see the projects where I have integrated new technologies as a reference for the future and see my progress on them. Hopefully they can be useful to others who are learning the same concepts.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

All of these projects will most likely be in an unoptimized state. These items are not ment to be production quality, I am just using new concepts and technolgy to understand how they work and get them working with the bare minimun effort.

## Lessons Learned:

I believe that a core part of being a software engineer is continuos learning,  no matter what your experience level is. Every time you build something with a new language, framework, tech you get those *heck yeah I did it!* moments which motivates us to keep the learning going. This passion allows me to keep making the software I develop be the best it can be,  to serve the needs of clients and the people they serve.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
